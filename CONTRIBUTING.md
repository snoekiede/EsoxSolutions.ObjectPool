# Coding Standards
## General Guidelines
-	Follow C# and .NET standard naming conventions
-	Use nullable reference types (Nullable enable)
-	Ensure code is thread-safe where appropriate
-	Use asynchronous programming patterns correctly
## Style Conventions
-	Use Pascal case for class names, method names, and public members
-	Use camel case for private fields, parameters, and local variables
-	Prefix private fields with underscore (e.g., _myField)
-	Use meaningful names that describe purpose
-	Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized
## Structure and Organization
-	Keep methods short and focused on a single responsibility
-	Organize related functionality into cohesive classes
-	Maintain proper interface abstractions
-	Use dependency injection where appropriate
## Documentation
-	All public APIs must have XML documentation comments
-	Include summary, parameters, returns, and exceptions where relevant
-	Use clear, concise language
## Constants and Magic Strings
-	Use the PoolConstants class for string constants and magic values
-	Organize constants in the appropriate nested class based on their purpose
# Testing Guidelines
## Test Structure
-	Use descriptive test names that indicate:
-	The scenario being tested
-	The expected behavior
-	Any special conditions
Example: TestMaxPoolSizeLimit_WithMoreInitialObjectsThanAllowed_ThrowsArgumentException
## Test Coverage Requirements
-	All public methods must have unit tests
-	Test both success and failure paths
-	Include edge cases and boundary conditions
-	Test thread-safety where relevant
## Performance Testing
-	Include performance tests for critical paths
-	Benchmark against previous versions for regressions
